/**
 * Each connection can carry a varying number streams, depending on the underlying protocol being
 * used. HTTP/1.x connections can carry either zero or one streams. HTTP/2 connections can carry any
 * number of streams, dynamically configured with {@code SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS}. A
 * connection currently carrying zero streams is an idle stream. We keep it alive because reusing an
 * existing connection is typically faster than establishing a new one.
 *
 * <p>When a single logical call requires multiple streams due to redirects or authorization
 * challenges, we prefer to use the same physical connection for all streams in the sequence. There
 * are potential performance and behavior consequences to this preference. To support this feature,
 * this class separates <i>allocations</i> from <i>streams</i>. An allocation is created by a call,
 * used for one or more streams, and then released. An allocated connection won't be stolen by
 * other calls while a redirect or authorization challenge is being handled.
 *
 * <p>When the maximum concurrent streams limit is reduced, some allocations will be rescinded.
 * Attempting to create new streams on these allocations will fail.
 *
 * <p>Note that an allocation may be released before its stream is completed. This is intended to
 * make bookkeeping easier for the caller: releasing the allocation as soon as the terminal stream
 * has been found. But only complete the stream once its data stream has been exhausted.
